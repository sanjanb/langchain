# Lesson 2 – Introduction to LangChain

Building applications with large language models (LLMs) has become one of the most exciting areas of modern AI, but anyone who has tried to go beyond simple API calls quickly realizes that it is not straightforward. LLMs are powerful on their own, yet to build real-world products we need to integrate them with multiple components such as databases, external APIs, data loaders, and memory modules. Without a framework, developers would need to spend weeks writing boilerplate code to manage orchestration, data preprocessing, and model switching. This is the exact gap that LangChain fills. LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of applications powered by LLMs. It provides ready-to-use building blocks that make it possible to connect models, tools, and data sources in a seamless pipeline.

To understand why LangChain is needed, consider a simple example of a “Chat with your PDF” application. Suppose a student uploads a textbook and wants to ask it a question such as, _“What are the assumptions of Linear Regression?”_ If we only relied on keyword search, the system might return dozens of irrelevant pages containing those words without real context. A better approach is semantic search, where both the user’s query and the document’s content are transformed into embeddings—numerical vectors that capture meaning rather than just words. The query embedding can then be compared with the document embeddings to find the most relevant chunks of text. These chunks are passed, along with the user’s question, into an LLM which understands the query and generates a coherent, context-aware answer. This process, however, requires orchestrating many components — document loaders, text splitters, embedding models, a vector database, and finally the LLM. LangChain provides abstractions for each step and makes it possible to connect them with just a few lines of code, instead of reinventing every part of the pipeline.

What LangChain essentially solves are three major challenges in the LLM application lifecycle. First, it builds on the fact that LLMs themselves are now highly capable “brains” for natural language understanding and generation. Second, it bypasses the computational overhead of running massive models by allowing easy integration with APIs from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google. And third, it addresses the orchestration problem, which is the most difficult part — connecting diverse systems into a reliable pipeline. By offering a plug-and-play ecosystem, LangChain lets developers swap components like vector databases, cloud storage, or LLM providers without rewriting the application logic.

This framework brings several benefits that make it attractive for developers. Its concept of “chains” allows for constructing sequential or parallel pipelines where outputs from one component naturally feed into the next. It is model-agnostic, so developers are not locked into a single provider and can switch between GPT, Claude, or open-source LLaMA models with minimal changes. The ecosystem is vast, including dozens of document loaders, text splitters, embedding models, and memory systems. Most importantly, LangChain enables developers to quickly prototype real-world applications, whether they are chatbots, AI knowledge assistants, autonomous agents, or summarization tools. By handling context and memory, it also supports natural conversation flow, so users can ask follow-up questions without repeating details.

LangChain is not the only framework in this space — alternatives such as LlamaIndex and Haystack offer similar capabilities. However, LangChain stands out for its developer-friendly abstractions and wide adoption. Its role is critical in unlocking the true potential of LLMs, enabling individuals and organizations to build sophisticated AI applications faster, with fewer barriers.

This introduction sets the foundation for the lessons ahead. In the next lesson, we will explore LangChain’s practical building blocks—its components, installation workflow, and how to construct your first runnable pipeline—so you can start applying these concepts immediately.
