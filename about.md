# About Sanjan B M

I'm **Sanjan B M** an engineer and writer focused on making AI concepts practical and accessible.

My areas of interest:

- 🤖 Generative AI systems and application architecture
- 📚 Learning frameworks that build durable understanding
- 🔧 Clear abstractions over implementation complexity

I believe in learning that compounds across domains rather than chasing trends.

> *"The best way to understand AI is to build with it."*

## About This Site

This is a structured learning path for building real applications with **LangChain** and modern LLM tooling. The focus is on developing precise conceptual understanding and building production-ready systems step by step.

> 💡 **Why this course exists:** Most AI tutorials teach you to copy-paste code. This course teaches you to *think* in AI patterns and build systems that scale.

### Learning Philosophy

- **Clarity over novelty** – Fewer concepts, deeply understood ✨
- **Execution awareness** – Understanding how components actually work together 🔍
- **Precise naming** – Distinguishing tools vs. agents, prompts vs. templates 🎯
- **Progressive building** – Start concrete, then generalize 📈
- **Testable components** – Every piece should be reusable and evaluable ✅

## What You'll Find

| **Curriculum** | Sequenced path from fundamentals → retrieval → agents |
| **Projects** | Guided builds reinforcing core patterns |
| **Capstone** | Enterprise RAG system integrating all concepts |

### Course Structure

**Part 1: Fundamentals**  
Components, models, prompts, parsing, chains, memory

**Part 2: Retrieval (RAG)**  
Loaders, embeddings, vector stores, end-to-end RAG systems

**Part 3: Agents**  
Tools, reasoning, structured workflows, autonomous systems

**Projects**  
Chatbot → Summarizer → Knowledge Base → Assistant → Enterprise RAG

## How to Use This Site

1. **Start with curriculum** if you want the complete path
2. **Preview lessons** by reading "Why this matters" sections first
3. **Build immediately** – complete projects after prerequisite lessons
4. **Refactor later** – revisit code once you learn new abstractions
5. **Keep notes** – maintain a personal glossary for precision
