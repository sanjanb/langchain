<div class="about-section">

I'm **Sanjan B M** an engineer and writer interested in:

- Generative AI systems and practical application architecture
- Abstractions: how representations, constraints, and correspondences shape design
- Systematic learning: layering conceptual clarity over implementation detail

I care about durable understanding: learning in a way that compounds across adjacent domains (retrieval systems, agents, evaluation, deployment, reasoning patterns) instead of chasing surface-level trends.

# About This Site

This site is a focused learning hub for practitioners who want a structured, foundation-first path into Generative AI,especially building real applications with LangChain and modern LLM tooling. The goal is to help learners develop precise conceptual language, internalize core abstractions, and build production-minded systems step by step.

## Learning Philosophy

The curriculum deliberately emphasizes:

1. **Clarity over novelty** – Fewer concepts, deeply understood.
2. **Execution model awareness** – How tokens flow, how chains compose, how retrieval interacts with generation.
3. **Naming things precisely** – Distinguishing prompts vs. prompt templates, retrievers vs. vector stores, tools vs. agents, runnables vs. chains.
4. **Progressive generalization** – Start concrete (one model, one dataset), then abstract (multiple providers, interchangeable components).
5. **Reusability and evaluation** – Treat every artifact (prompt, splitter, retriever, parser) as a testable unit.

## What You Will Find Here

| Area       | Description                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Curriculum | A sequenced path from fundamentals → retrieval → agents |
| Projects   | Guided builds reinforcing applied patterns              |
| Capstone   | Enterprise-style RAG system integrating all layers      |
| Reference  | Clean conceptual explanations without hype              |

## Current Structure

- **Part 1 – Fundamentals**: Components, models, prompts, parsing, runnables, chains, memory
- **Part 2 – Retrieval (RAG)**: Loaders, splitters, embeddings, vector stores, retrievers, end‑to‑end RAG
- **Part 3 – Agents**: Tools, tool calling, structured reasoning, agent assembly
- **Mini Projects**: Chatbot, summarizer, knowledge base, multi-tool assistant
- **Capstone**: Multi-tenant, production-aligned RAG system

## How to Use the Site

1. Start at the curriculum overview if you want the full path.
2. Skim a lesson’s “Why this matters” section before diving into code examples.
3. Build each mini‑project immediately after finishing its prerequisite lessons.
4. Refactor earlier code once you learn later abstractions (e.g., replace ad‑hoc orchestration with runnables).
5. Keep a personal glossary,precision accelerates mastery.
