# 🧠 Project 3: RAG-powered Knowledge Base

**Build an intelligent knowledge base that answers questions from your documents!**

## 🎯 Project Overview

Create a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that can:

- Index and search through your document collection
- Answer questions with accurate, contextual responses
- Cite sources and provide evidence
- Handle complex, multi-hop queries
- Scale to large document collections

## 📚 Prerequisites

- **Lessons Required**: 1-11
- **Python Knowledge**: Intermediate to Advanced
- **Estimated Time**: 4-5 hours

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **LangChain**: RAG pipeline and orchestration
- **Chroma/Pinecone**: Vector database
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: Text embeddings
- **FastAPI**: Backend API
- **React/Streamlit**: Frontend interface
- **Docker**: Containerization

## 📊 Example Interaction

```
User: "What are the key findings about climate change in the IPCC reports?"

System: Based on the IPCC AR6 reports in your knowledge base, here are the key findings:

1. **Global Temperature Rise**: The global surface temperature has increased by 1.1°C since 1850-1900, with human activities being the primary driver.

2. **Extreme Weather**: Heat extremes, heavy precipitation, and droughts have become more frequent and intense in many regions.

3. **Sea Level Rise**: Global mean sea level has risen by 0.21m from 1901-2018, with the rate of rise accelerating.

- IPCC AR6 Working Group I Summary (Page 5)
- IPCC AR6 Working Group II Chapter 12 (Page 234)
- IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report (Page 12)
